# Fingerprint-Shazam-like-app- 
Fingerprinting is basically to identify a signal based on a short sample for it which usually has its intrinsic features and thus these intrinsic features can be used to identify the different varieties or flavors of the signal. Several applications can be directly spotted for such technique. For example:
Music industry: Identify a song, a singer voice, a tune.
Medical diagnosis: identify arrhythmia types in ECG signals.

We have implemented a desktop application where you can upload a song; the software extracts its features and compares it with the features of the song on the database created, the output is a list of songs in a database ordered by the similarity index with the uploaded song.
